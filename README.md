# Spotify Status

Expose your currently playing track on Spotify, alongside Spotify profile, recently played tracks and top items, to a public API. You can then use the API to grab the information without having to authenticate any further. This minimizes the pain-in-the-ass to work with Spotify Authorization and thus all you need is your Spotify User ID.
